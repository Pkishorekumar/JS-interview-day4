   <h1>How many operators do we have in JS ?</h1>
   <pre>
    1. Arithmetic Operators : + - * / %
    2. Comparison Operators : == === != !==
    3. Logical Operators : && || !
    4. Assignment Operators : =
    5. Conditional Operators
    6. Ternary Operator ?:

   <h1>What are pure functions?</h1>
   <pre>
    a pure function is a function thats return the same output as given as the same input.this pure function 
    is only deppend on its input arguments only
   </pre>
   <h1>What is callback hell</h1>
   <pre>
    Callback Hell is a pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and
    debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like a pyramid structure.
   </pre>
   <h1>What is promise chaining</h1>
   <pre>
    The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is
    known as Promise chaining
   </pre>
   <h1>What are arrow functions?</h1>
   <pre>
    Arrow Functions — also called “fat arrow” functions, are relatively a new way of writing
    concise functions in JavaScript. They have been introduced by the ECMAScript 6
    specifications and since then become the most popular ES6 feature. Arrow functions allow us
    to use the fat arrow => operator to quickly define JavaScript functions, with or without
    parameters. We are able to omit the curly braces and the function and return keywords.

   <h1>Give an example of async/await</h1>
   <pre>
    function resolveAfter2Seconds()
    return new Promise(resolve =>
    {
    setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('resolved')
    }, 2000);
    });
    }
    async function asyncCall() {
    console.log('calling');
    const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
    console.log(result);
    // expected output: "resolved"
   </pre>
   <h1>What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h1>
 <pre>
    The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable
    with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const
    variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when
    that happens, between the creation of a variable's binding and its declaration, is called the
    temporal dead zone.
